Risk Team was responsible for inhibiting end to end fraud and hedge any loose ends from potential exploitations by users – right from
acquisition through retention strategies and in-game violations
A free hand from the senior leadership had been one of the biggest drivers to explore plenty of new tools and advanced techniques
that could be leveraged to our use
Orchestrated new feature developments in the face of Game Timer Optimization, revamping the entire KYC Process, tweaking the
Game Table Allocation algorithm to inhibit the fraud avenues by considerable margin based on data driven insights.

and be instrumental in smooth and uninterrupted implementation with everyone onboard
Revamped the existing Withdrawal Rule Engine from the grassroot level which reduced the Impact Rate by more than 30% and yet
increased the fraud coverage by ~40% - resulting in a daily capture of Rs.2L incrementally
Included rules monitoring the player skills and average behaviour, past journey, bonus farmed, etc.
Drove project to establish a more holistic and robust Rule Engine for a more proactive approach towards the ongoing fraud and
detain the money previously being easily drained out from the system
Developed a computational strategy to predict in game collusions between players due to card sharing
Other projects included – Responsible Gameplay whereby customers with higher losses are identified at an early stage to prevent
them from taking any drastic steps
Leveraged new data based on IP and device information of a player to address Multiple ID Fraud

been granted. If bot faces some issue relevant to lack of data or permission denied bot updates the incident
accordingly and the UAM support team member picks the incident for further investigation

• Purpose: Provide best real-time fills to live orders using Machine Learning model trained on clients' historical trading data
The Client Interest Prediction model aims at providing quick real-time matches for client orders. By training itself on client's historical
holdings and recent trading interests, as well as liquidity/price volatility of stocks, the model scores the clients' interest using Deep Learning
techniques. Depending on actual actions taken by sales traders based on these scores, the model further trains and improves itself daily,
facilitating more targeted and effective sales pitches for the desk.
• Models/Tools: Neural Networks, Gradient boosting decision trees, Factorization machine, Python, Java, Tableau (EDA)
• Performance: +12% order leads QoQ / +133% hit rate for top 5 stocks / +183% hit rate of top 5 predictions per client

• Delivery of market share/client interest/trade flow Business Intelligence (BI) metrics in Tableau / SQL / Python
The BI dashboards serve as a real-time visual monitor for the Sales Traders/Traders, to track client activities, market share, stock unwind

The results of the analysis allow identifying/cornering any specific stocks/trades contributing excessively to the unwind costs, and thus help

"Fixed Income Business : Fixed Income Credit, Fixed Income Syndicate &
Fixed Income Financing are the three models come under Fixed Income
business. Fl Credit has been modelled at segment level using combination of
regression-based & formulaic linkage approach. Transfer pricing calculation is
applied on the aggregated sum to get Barclays Revenue. Fl Syndicate & FI
Financing both are modelled at industry level & multiplied by market share to
generate Barclays IHC Revenue.
Equity Business: Three different models under this business are: Equity
Syndicate, Equity Trading & Equity Financing. Regression-based approach
has been used to calculate the industry level forecast for Equity Syndicate
Model. Market share & Transfer pricing calculation is applied on industry fee to
get the final Barclay's revenue. Equity Trading has been modelled at revenue
level using a hybrid approach for different segments. Equity financing model has
used formulaic linkage along with some business judgment to get the final
Barclays revenue.
Advisory Business: Advisory Business encompasses all mergers & acquisitions
activity that Barclays conducts on behalf of its clients. Initially, Advisory model
uses regression to estimate the relation between total industry-wide revenue &
macroeconomic variables. Total industry fees are modelled as a single
component because various segments are assumed to be impacted in same way
by macro factors.
Macro Business: Macro PPNR Model is focused on three material segments: FL
Rates, Agency RMBS & EFICC. Projections for Fl Rates & EFICC total revenue are
generated using the outputs from OLS regression models of external industry-wide data, in conjunction with constant parameter estimate for Barclay's
historical average market share. Agency RMBS Revenue projections are linked to
Fl Rates projection.
